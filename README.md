This package contains utilities that take care of most of the tedious tasks in the implementation of an HTTP API with 
Flask or AioHTTP:

- request body validation using [Schematics](https://github.com/schematics/schematics)
- response serialization and validation
- API documentation generation using OpenAPI v3 specifications (also with Swagger UI)

## Usage

First, you need to initialize the extension and bind it to your app.

### Flask

```python
from flask import Flask
from apistrap.flask import FlaskApistrap
app = Flask(__name__)
oapi = FlaskApistrap()
oapi.init_app(app)
oapi.title = "Some title for your API"
oapi.description = "A description of the API"
```

You will probably want to put this into a separate module so that you can import it in your blueprint files.

**Important**: A big part of the functionality is exposed using decorators on Flask view functions. Make sure that the 
Flask `route()` decorator is always the last applied one (the one on the top). Otherwise, the HTTP handler might not 
call some of our functions.

### AioHTTP

```python
from aiohttp import web
from apistrap.aiohttp import AioHTTPApistrap

oapi = AioHTTPApistrap()
oapi.title = "Some title for your API"
oapi.description = "A description of the API"

routes = web.RouteTableDef()

@routes.get("/endpoint")
def endpoint(request):
    return web.Response(text="Lorem ipsum")


app = web.Application()
app.add_routes(routes)
oapi.init_app(app)

web.run_app(app)
```

Please note that this is very similar to how Apistrap works with Flask. All decorators that work with Flask routes work
the same with AioHTTP web routes. Also, you still have to put the route decorators on top.

We also make it possible to read route parameters using function parameters like you would with Flask:

```python
from aiohttp import web
from apistrap.aiohttp import AioHTTPApistrap

oapi = AioHTTPApistrap()
routes = web.RouteTableDef()

@routes.get("/{param_a}/{param_b}")
def endpoint(param_a: str, param_b: int = 5):  # Note that the request parameter is optional
    return web.Response(text="Lorem ipsum")
```

### Request Body Parsing

```python
from schematics import Model
from schematics.types import StringType
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from apistrap.flask import FlaskApistrap

app = Flask(__name__)
oapi = FlaskApistrap()
oapi.init_app(app)

class Request(Model):
    some_field = StringType(required=True)

@app.route("/<param>")
@oapi.accepts(Request)
def view(param: str, request: Request):
    """
    A description of the endpoint
    """
    return jsonify({})
```

In this example, the request is automatically de-serialized from JSON, validated according to the Schematics model and 
passed to the view function in a parameter with a type annotation that matches that of the Schematics model. If the 
validation fails, error 400 is returned with a list of validation errors (the exact format is described in the API 
specification).

Note that the doc block will be parsed and used in the API specification as a description of the endpoint.

### Response Declaration and Validation

```python
from schematics import Model
from schematics.types import StringType
from flask import Flask
from apistrap.flask import FlaskApistrap

app = Flask(__name__)
oapi = FlaskApistrap()
oapi.init_app(app)

class MyResponse(Model):
    some_field = StringType(required=True)

class NotReadyResponse(Model):
    status = StringType(required=True)

@app.route("/")
@oapi.responds_with(MyResponse, code=201)  # Code is optional
@oapi.responds_with(NotReadyResponse, code=202)
def view():
    return MyResponse(some_field="Some value")
```

In this example, the response format is inferred from the model and added to the specification. Also, the return values
from the view function are automatically validated and serialized to JSON. If an undeclared response type or an invalid 
response object is encountered, an error (code 500) is returned.

### Working with the Specification File

You can obtain the OpenAPI specification through `http://yourapi.tld/spec.json`. This file can be used by 
Swagger-related utilities. The specification file can be put under a different URL with 
`oapi.spec_url = '/anything.json'`. By setting `oapi.spec_url` to `None`, you can effectively hide the 
specification.

The extension also serves the Swagger UI automatically. You can browse it on `http://yourapi.tld/apidocs/`. You can 
change the URL of the UI with `oapi.ui_url = "/docs_url/`. This feature can be turned off completely with 
`oapi.ui_url = None`.

### Organizing Endpoints Using Tags

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify
from apistrap.flask import FlaskApistrap

app = Flask(__name__)
oapi = FlaskApistrap()
oapi.init_app(app)

@app.route("/")
@oapi.tags("Tag 1", "Tag 2")
def view():
    return jsonify({})
```

In this example, you can see how to organize the endpoints in Swagger UI into categories determined by tags.

### Documenting Schematics Models

In order to have nice titles and descriptions in your specification, you have to write them in your Schematics models 
like so:

```python
from schematics import Model
from schematics.types import StringType

class MyResponse(Model):
    some_field = StringType(required=True, metadata={
        "label": "Short, informative label (title in the spec)",
        "description": "Extended description of the schema (description in the spec)"
    })
```

Apistrap automatically picks this up and puts it in the specification.

**Heads up**: When you use compound types (e.g. `ListType`) with a field type and not a field instance (e.g. 
`ListType(StringType)` instead of `ListType(StringType())`), the metadata gets passed down to the `StringType`, 
which might result in weird specification files and minor headaches. We suggest to always instantiate the field type.

## Running Tests

In a cloned repository, run `python setup.py test` after installing both regular and development requirements with 
`pip`.
